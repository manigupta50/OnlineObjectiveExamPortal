## Requirements-

For development, you will need Node and a node global package, npm, installed in your environment.

## Installation-

- #### Node installation on Windows

    Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
    Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

    You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

        $ sudo apt install nodejs
        $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
    You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

    If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

        $ node --version
        v8.11.3

        $ npm --version
        6.1.0

    If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm` or manage the version using nvm! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

        $ npm install npm -g
